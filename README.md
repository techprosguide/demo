What was done

Here’s a summary of the changes made to add pagination and centralized exception handling, suitable for a YouTube tutorial explanation:  1. Pagination Support  
Updated the UserService and UserServiceImpl to use Spring Data’s Pageable and return a Page<UserDto>.
Modified the UserPersistenceService to fetch users with pagination.
In the UserController, changed the getAllUsers endpoint to accept pagination parameters and return either the full Page<UserDto> (with metadata) or just the user list (getContent()), depending on requirements.
Now, clients can request /users?page=0&size=10 to get paginated results.
2. Centralized Exception Handling  
   Added a GlobalExceptionHandler class using @ControllerAdvice.
   This class handles exceptions like UserNotFoundException, validation errors, and generic exceptions, returning consistent API responses using the ApiResponse wrapper.
3. Delete Endpoint Response  
   Updated the delete endpoint to return only a success message (no extra data) using ApiResponse<Void>.
   Summary for Video  
   Pagination makes user listing scalable and efficient.
   Centralized exception handling ensures all errors are returned in a consistent format.
   API responses are now cleaner and more user-friendly, especially for delete operations.
   These changes improve the maintainability, scalability, and user experience of your Spring Boot application.
